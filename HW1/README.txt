Hello,

You can either choose to execute questions 1 by 1 like:
py q1.py
OR
You can choose to run main to see answers of questions:
py main.py

Explanations can be found in .docx formatted file. To see codes that is explained in .docx, one can use the method described above.

Also, q5 and q7 has additional output files that can be obtained when you execute corresponding python files. However, for the sake of wellbeing of the TA, I did not remove them from the .zip.

It was a pleasure to do the homework,
